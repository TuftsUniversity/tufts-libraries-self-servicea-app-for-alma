create a module that will fit into a larger Flask application structure where these files get renamed the following where the barnes_and_noble.py file gets renamed sql.py, and references changed in the routes and sql.py file accordingly

and create a template to be housed at a higher level , in the template folder in the /app folder that will also contain the files here, that has two textarea inputs that allow users to paste in sql that follow the format of sql_input_1.sql and sql_input_2.sql and combine them such that they appear like sql_output.sql

The sql.py will contain the required processing to make this happen.  Note that the two individual sql files are combined in a join (what kind of join -- left , right, outer, inner that will be specified in a dropdown) such that a higher level SELECT statement contains all fields from both reports, and the aliases get renamed from "saw_x" to the field name in quotes, with spaces replaced by underscores and any special characters take out,   and the matching column that is being joined on is MMS ID

It should then output in an output text area the desired sql query that has this join
